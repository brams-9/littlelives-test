# Flutter Project

## Status: Incomplete

### Dear LittleLive Engineering Team,

I regret to inform you that I was unable to complete the assigned Flutter project within the given 4-hour timeframe. Due to unforeseen complications at the start of the test, I only had 30 minutes remaining to begin the project. Despite my best efforts, this limited time was insufficient to produce a satisfactory result.

I understand that this outcome is unacceptable, and I take full responsibility for the delay and any inconvenience caused. I deeply value this opportunity and am committed to demonstrating my capabilities under better circumstances.

I kindly ask for your understanding and hope to be considered for a re-application next year. I am eager to improve and better manage my time to meet your expectations in the future.

Thank you for your consideration.
